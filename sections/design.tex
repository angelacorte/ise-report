\section{Design}

This is where the logical / abstract contribution of the project is presented.

Notice that, when describing a software project, three dimensions need to be taken into account: structure, behaviour, and interaction.

Always remember to report \textbf{why} a particular design has been chosen.
Reporting wrong design choices which has been evalued during the design phase is welcome too.
