\subsection{Goals}

The main goal of the project is to extend the JaKtA library to allow the construction of distributed multi-agent systems
over a network while avoiding the library user from having to deal with the complexities of network communications.

\subsection{Requirements}
Based on the main objective of the project, the following functional, non-functional and implementation requirements were identified.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements outline the specific functions of the system, that is, what the system is to do:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Managing the distribution of agents:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \textit{middleware} must support the distribution of agents across heterogeneous machines,
            enabling their coordinated execution on different geographical locations.
      \end{enumerate}

      \item Implementation of a mechanism to \textit{dispatch} messages between agents:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \textit{middleware} must exploit a \textit{broker} for network communication:
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item The \textit{broker} must allow the addition of \textit{publisher} associated with a given \textit{topic}.
                  \item The \textit{broker} must allow the removal of \textit{publisher} associated with a specific \textit{topic}.
                  \item The \textit{broker} must support the addition of \textit{subscriber} associated with a specific \textit{topic}.
                  \item The \textit{broker} must allow the removal of \textit{subscriber} associated with a specific \textit{topic}.
                  \item The broker must provide a list of all available topics.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item The \textit{middleware} must incorporate a \textit{client} that interfaces with the \textit{broker}:
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item The \textit{client} must provide the functionality of posting a message on a given \textit{topic}.
                  \item The client must provide the ability to subscribe to a specific \textit{topic}.
                  \item The system must allow the \textit{client} to perform a broadcast \textit{broadcast}, sending a message to all other connected \textit{clients}.
                  \item The \textit{client} must be able to establish and manage \textit{WebSocket} connections to a \textit{broker} specified by \textit{IP} address and port.
            \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Distributed Communication and Coordination:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \textit{middleware} must handle distributed communication between agents, enabling message exchange and coordination of activities.
            \item It must support synchronization of distributed agents to ensure cohesive and coordinated interaction.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Nonfunctional requirements define quality attributes, constraints, and general properties of the system:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item The \textit{middleware} must be implemented in separate modules so that it can be easily maintained and extended.
      \item The \textit{middleware} must be designed to scale horizontally, easily supporting the addition of new nodes without degrading performance.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Requirements}
Implementation requirements concern the technological and methodological aspects of system implementation:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item The project must be implemented using the Kotlin programming language to ensure consistency and compatibility with the JaKtA library.
      \item Use the Ktor \textit{framework} to implement the \textit{middleware} for interaction between distributed multi-agent systems.
\end{enumerate}

% \subsubsection{Requisiti non funzionali}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item  Il sistema deve essere scalabile, consentendo l'aggiunta di nuovi client e broker senza compromettere le prestazioni generali del sistema.
%     \item
%     \item
% \end{enumerate}
